 *
 * Example of using NRF24L01 driver by Neil MacMillan in an Arduino plataform.
 *
 * Based on the examples by Neil MacMillan in http://nrqm.ca/nrf24l01/examples/
 *
 * Adapted by Miguel Moreto
 * Brazil, 2011.
 *
 * This example was tested in a Teensy 2.0++ board (AT90USB1286) with teensyduino.
 *
 * Behavior:
 *  This sketch will wait for a MESSAGE packet from the sender and after received an ACK 
 *  packet will be transmitted to the sender.
 * 	The Led will turn on when a packet is received.
 *	The Led will turn off after successfully transmitting an ACK packet.
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 *   Make sure you have the correct CE_PIN and CSN_PIN definitions in radio.cpp and
 *   also MISO, MOSI, SCK and SS pins in spi.cpp
 *   
 *   Copy nRF24L01.h, packet.h, radio.cpp, radio.h, spi.cpp and spi.h in the same
 *   folder of your sketch.
 *  
 *   You also have to replace the #include "../arduino/WProgram.h" in radio.cpp, spi.cpp
 *   by #include "WProgram.h".
 *
 *   If you use teensy board, you have to change the spi pins macros in spi.cpp in order
 *   to include the teensy processors: __AVR_ATmega32U4__ (teensy 2.0) or __AVR_AT90USB1286__ (teensy 2.0++)
